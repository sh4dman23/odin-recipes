        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 readymade pizza base</li>
            <li>150 gm shredded mozzarella</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tablespoon tomato ketchup</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon powdered salt</li>
            <li>1 pinch powdered black pepper</li>
            <li>100 gm chopped onion</li>
            <li>100 gm chopped tomato</li>
            <li>70 gm chopped capsicum ( green pepper)</li>
            <li>50 gm sliced mushroom</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven on convection mode at 250 degree Celsius. Meanwhile, spread the tomato sauce evenly on each pizza base. Take a chopping board and chop onions, tomatoes, capsicum and mushroom on it.</li>
            <li>Mix all the chopped vegetables and seasoning in a bowl. Microwave these vegetables in a microwave-safe bowl for around 30-40 seconds or a minute. Spread this vegetable topping on each pizza base. Sprinkle grated mozzarella cheese at the top of each pizza.</li>
            <li>You can either bake this pizza in a microwave or you can use a non-stick tawa for the same. However, in this recipe we have used microwave. Bake the pizza on the high rack at 250 degree Celsius till the cheese melts. It will take around 10-12 minutes. Once baked, add some extra virgin olive oil over the pizza and cut the delicious Cheese Pizza into slices. Serve with sauces.</li>
        </ol>
